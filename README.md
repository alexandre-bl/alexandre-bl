I'm a Portuguese teenager who likes to code.

I've also got a [website](https://alexandrebl.com) and an [Itch.io](https://alexandrebl.itch.io/) page.

You can also email me at alexandrebl@protonmail.com.

*P.S.: Sorry for the bad commit messages you are bound to see if you decide to explore my profile any further, none of the code here is necessarily even working, think of it more as a backup of the files on my machine.*
